# MULTIVARIATE-STATISTICS-IN-R-

In the world of business it is important to communicate with the data and test the hypotheses for making better decisions

When the dataset has few variables it is easy to analysis and test the analyses

But when we have multivariate dataset things become a bit daunting

In this project I have analysed a multivariate dataset of Smartphones Usage and tested the hypotheses with different multivariate statistical testing techniques

I have used the programming language R for my project.

I have attached both the cookbook with the R code and a ppt

People who come from the business side can refer the ppt directly
